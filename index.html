<div class="hov-div">
    <p class="hov-reveal"><sup>*</sup> This is a photograph of my father. <sup>**</sup></p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div2">
    <p class="hov-reveal2">In the summer of 1973, &nbsp;&nbsp; my father would learn the words to <em>Tie a Yellow Ribbon &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'round the Old Oak Tree,</em> and run– his feet bare and heavy– in &nbsp;&nbsp; 12 x 12 circles on the front lawn.</p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div3">
    <p class="hov-reveal3">He plays lotto every week- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night at the 7-11 on 347. The un-won winnings have already been thoughtfully distributed.</p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div4">
    <p class="hov-reveal4">My father &nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't talk about his father. <sup>***</sup></p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div5">
    <p class="hov-reveal5"><sup>**</sup> Here, with his brother, Rich. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside his apartment, in Queens.</p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div6">
    <p class="hov-reveal6">There are 30,000 miles on his car between Suffolk &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Nassau.</p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div7">
    <p class="hov-reveal7"><sup>***</sup> Challah instead of rye.</p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div8">
    <p class="hov-reveal8">We went out a few weekends ago. I'd taken him out to breakfast, in the hopes of &nbsp;&nbsp; buttering him up over &nbsp;&nbsp; coffee and toast. <sup>***</sup></p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div9">
    <p class="hov-reveal9"><sup>***</sup> I'd meant to take him somewhere far nicer, &nbsp;&nbsp; with something far nicer. <sup>***</sup></p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div10">
    <p class="hov-reveal10">I ask my father if he remembers &nbsp;&nbsp; when this was taken. He picks his cuticles in time with the wall-clock &nbsp; second-hand. <sup>**</sup></p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div11">
    <p class="hov-reveal11">He's timid around words like &nbsp;&nbsp;'dream' and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'lesbian.' <sup>*******</sup></p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div12">
    <p class="hov-reveal12">I once asked him to tell me a secret in exchange for one of my own. He did &nbsp;&nbsp; not have anything to give.</p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div13">
    <p class="hov-reveal13">In my mind, &nbsp;&nbsp; he's laying on our living room carpet, sun from the window &nbsp;&nbsp; reddening the top of his head. When he rises, he does so with a sharp exhale.</p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div14">
    <p class="hov-reveal14">He met my mother at a furniture store. She dusted, &nbsp;&nbsp; he stocked.</p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div15">
    <p class="hov-reveal15">I cannot find his &nbsp;&nbsp; father's obituary and I do not remember his middle name. <sup>****</sup></p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div16">
    <p class="hov-reveal16">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is one framed photograph of his side of the family in his house. At Christmastime, &nbsp;&nbsp; he unsheathes the printer-paper-photo- &nbsp;&nbsp; copy and checks for his kin on the back, &nbsp;&nbsp; named L-to-R. <sup>*****</sup></p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div17">
    <p class="hov-reveal17"><sup>****</sup> Their firsts are the same, &nbsp;&nbsp; and same as his son, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and his son.</p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div18">
    <p class="hov-reveal18">On my birthday, he sent me an email. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>'I love you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than you can imagine.'</em></p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div19">
    <p class="hov-reveal19">&nbsp;&nbsp; He eats peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with two napkins: one dry, for crumbs, &nbsp;&nbsp; one wet, for stains and spills.</p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div20">
    <p class="hov-reveal20">My father once unabashadely crawled through a playground tube &nbsp;&nbsp; to retrieve me (weeping &nbsp;&nbsp; and frozen on all fours– overcome by the view from so high.) I remember his starched-white shirt &nbsp;&nbsp; against the red plastic.</p>
</div>

<div class="hov-div21">
    <p class="hov-reveal21">He used to collect change in this horrible two-foot Budweiser-bottle piggy bank. &nbsp;&nbsp; Now they're in cardboard boxes beneath his bed, undeposited.</p>

<div class="hov-div29">
    <p class="hov-reveal29">&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to sit up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on his shoulders; &nbsp;&nbsp; rest both hands atop his head.</p>

<div class="hov-div30">
    <p class="hov-reveal30">I ask him &nbsp;&nbsp; to love me, and he replies.</p>
